# Individual Working Folder

## Dataset Upload and Access
Homework 1, Step 2 asks to upload the dataset to an appropriate storage location:
```
Step 2: Upload Your Dataset

Before proceeding, ensure your dataset is uploaded to the storage location you and your team have chosen (such as Hipergator, AWS S3, or another cloud-based platform).
```

The dataset I will use to fine-tune the MoveNet model to perform pose classification is uploaded onto Google Cloud Storage. This allows complete integration of dataset management with the tools necessary to train and explore the model using the products and services of one platform: Google.

## Purpose
This folder was created to follow the instructions from Homework 1, Step 1:
```
Step 1: Create Your Personal Folder

Set Up a Personal Folder:
In the project GitHub repository, each team member should create a folder named with their own name. For example: /AndreaRamirez.
```

This folder functions similarly to a `/src` folder; it contains all relevant source code (i.e., notebooks) which may be examined and executed.
